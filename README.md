# Friend App
## Purpose
Having trouble making friends? The purpose of this project is to develop an Android app that will help monitor and encourage engagement among Edmonds Community College students. This will help new students and even current students to connect and network with each other.
## Target User 
The target user for this app are the students that currently attend Edmonds Community College.
## Functionality
The app will allow the students at Edmonds Community College to potentially create meaningful relationships. It will help narrow down similarities to find their best fit in making new friends or creating study groups. Information about the students themselves will help filter for people with similar traits, characteristics, or even goals (intended majors).
## Limitations
This application is only limited to the student body at Edmonds Community College.
